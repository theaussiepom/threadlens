curl http://localhost:8128/api/v1/report.yaml
```

## Events query parameters

| Parameter | Values | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `window` | `24h`, `7d` | Time window (default `24h`) |
| `limit` | 1–500 | Maximum events returned (default 100) |
| `subject_type` | string | Optional subject type filter |
| `subject_id` | string | Optional subject id filter |
| `event_type` | string | Optional event type filter |

## Dashboard endpoint

`GET /api/v1/dashboard` returns a read-only, bounded JSON payload intended for the future Core-served dashboard UI. It aggregates health, OTBR, Matter, mDNS, TREL, MQTT status, recent events, and report links from Core storage — without Home Assistant device/entity registry enrichment.

During the migration period, the HACS integration may still serve its own dashboard panel; this endpoint is the canonical Core-side data source.

## Dashboard UI (static assets)

When built dashboard static assets are present, Core serves them from a configurable directory (`THREADLENS_STATIC_DIR`, default `/app/static` in the container image). `GET /` returns the dashboard `index.html`, and unknown frontend routes fall back to that shell for SPA routing.

The repository currently ships a small placeholder dashboard shell only. The full dashboard UI port is a follow-on pass. API-only mode still works when static assets are absent — `GET /` returns an HTML link page and all `/api/v1/...` routes behave as before.

The HACS integration dashboard remains the current production UI until the Core dashboard port is complete.
